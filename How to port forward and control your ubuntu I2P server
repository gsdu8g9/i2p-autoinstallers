If you are on a Window computer and want to control your Ubuntu I2P VPS Router,
1) Install OpenSSH for Windows
2) Restart Windows
3) Open Command Prompt Window (Windows Key + R + Enter CMD)
4) Use this command; ssh -f -N -L [Windows Port to use locally]:127.0.0.1:7657 [User SSH on VPS]@[VPS IP address]

Replace the first brackets with the port on your windows computer you'd like to use. This is what you will type in Firefox to access your server i2p. 
Replace the second brackets with the user login via ssh, normally can be "root" without quotes. 
Replace the third brackets with the IP address for your VPS server.

5) You will be prompted to enter your User login for the SSH user on your VPS
6) Congratz! Now go to 127.0.0.1:[THE Windows port you entered before] with firefox and you should be able to control your vps i2p router
